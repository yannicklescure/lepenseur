# lepenseur

Online publishing platform similar to Medium but it’s “le penseur” with the ability to share content privately to an approved crowd. The idea is to provide entrepreneurs with the ability to sell their knowledge through paid articles. Users can pay monthly fees to follow the writer's private articles.

## Features
### User:
- Read articles
- Comment if section is open
- CRUD comment
- Like articles
- Follow writers
- Pay to read private articles

### Writers:
- CRUD articles
- Manage articles to be public or private

### Articles:
- Be liked
- Be bookmarked
- Be commented or not
- Display views
- Be tagged with hashtags 

## Notes
Public articles are SEO friendly to be searchable on the web.
Private articles are protected by router conditions and include open graph and other meta stuff for SEO, however landing pages will propose to subscribe to paid services and follow the writer.

*As a MVP, payability will be fake.*
